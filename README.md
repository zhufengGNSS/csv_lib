csv_lib
=======

C++ functions for reading, writing, printing CSV files (Comma-Separated Values). 

I have used this several times for grading students. I save the Microsoft Excel sheets as .csv files, and use this program to read and update them automatically or semi-automatically. At the end I open the .csv file in Microsoft Excel and save them as Excel sheets. 

Sheet cells are loaded into std vectors of strings which make them easier to manipulate.
